# golang Sandbox (code examples)

This project doesn't have any specifc goals. I aim to use this repository to document any specific problems I face whilst developing in go. I will use this space to expreiment with different solutions and verify the behaviour (perhaps incorporating unit tests).

## func overloading: [overloading.go](overloading.go) 
A code example demonstrating how to (& how not to) overload a method in golang, this can be useful in test scenarios where using 'live' values is unhelpful; such as time values.

Significantly inspired by [Golang Method Override](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38127673)
